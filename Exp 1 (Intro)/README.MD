# Experiment 1 : To study Introduction and overview of cloud computing

## 1️⃣ What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence over the Internet (“the cloud”) instead of using local computers or physical servers.

Instead of:

* Buying expensive hardware
* Maintaining data centers
* Installing software manually

You can **rent resources on-demand** from cloud providers and pay only for what you use.

### 🔹 Simple Definition:

> Cloud computing is using remote servers on the internet to store, manage, and process data instead of a local computer.

## 2️⃣ Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. **On-Demand Self-Service** – Resources can be provisioned automatically.
2. **Broad Network Access** – Accessible from anywhere via internet.
3. **Resource Pooling** – Shared resources among multiple users.
4. **Rapid Elasticity** – Scale up or down quickly.
5. **Measured Service** – Pay-as-you-go model.

# 🏗️ 5️⃣ Deployment Models of Cloud

Deployment model defines **where the cloud infrastructure is located and who controls it.**

## 🔹 1. Public Cloud

* Owned by third-party providers
* Available to general public
* Cost-effective
* Example: AWS, Azure

✅ Best for startups & web apps
❌ Less control over data

---

## 🔹 2. Private Cloud


* Dedicated to one organization
* Higher security
* Can be on-premise or hosted

✅ Best for banks, hospitals
❌ Expensive

---

## 🔹 3. Hybrid Cloud

* Combination of public + private cloud
* Data & apps shared between them

✅ Flexible
✅ Balanced security & cost

---

## 🔹 4. Community Cloud

* Shared by multiple organizations
* Common concerns (security, compliance)
* Example: Government organizations

# 🧱 6️⃣ Service Models of Cloud Computing

Service model defines **what type of service you are using.**

---

## 🔹 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

* Provides virtual machines
* Storage
* Networking

User manages:

* OS
* Applications
* Data

Example:

* AWS EC2
* Azure Virtual Machines

✅ Full control
❌ Requires technical knowledge

---

## 🔹 2. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

* Provides development platform
* No need to manage servers

User manages:

* Applications
* Data

Example:

* Google App Engine
* Heroku

✅ Easy development
❌ Limited control

---

## 🔹 3. SaaS (Software as a Service)

* Ready-to-use software
* Access through browser

User manages:

* Only usage

Example:

* Gmail
* Zoom
* Microsoft 365

✅ No installation
✅ Low maintenance
❌ No backend control
